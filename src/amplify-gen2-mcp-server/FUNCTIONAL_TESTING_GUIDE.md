# AWS Strands Functional Testing Guide

## Overview

This enhanced test suite evaluates **how well LLMs can build Amplify Gen2 websites** using different MCP servers. Unlike basic technical tests that just check if servers work, these functional tests simulate real development scenarios and measure the quality of LLM-generated code and configurations.

## 🎯 What Makes This Different

### Traditional Testing vs. Functional LLM Testing

| Traditional Tests | Functional LLM Tests |
|------------------|---------------------|
| ✅ Server responds | 🎯 LLM builds working auth system |
| ✅ API calls work | 🎯 LLM creates proper GraphQL schema |
| ✅ No errors | 🎯 LLM follows security best practices |
| ✅ Basic connectivity | 🎯 LLM generates production-ready code |

### Key Innovation

These tests answer the critical question: **"Can an LLM actually build a real Amplify Gen2 application using this MCP server?"**

## 💡 Best Practices

### For MCP Server Developers
1. **Focus on Real Scenarios**: Optimize for actual development workflows
2. **Provide Rich Context**: Include examples, best practices, and common patterns
3. **Handle Edge Cases**: Prepare for complex, real-world requirements
4. **Maintain Quality**: Ensure generated code follows security and performance best practices

### For LLM Integration
1. **Clear Prompts**: Provide specific, detailed requirements
2. **Context Awareness**: Include relevant project context and constraints
3. **Iterative Refinement**: Use test feedback to improve prompts
4. **Validation**: Always validate generated code before deployment

This functional testing approach ensures that MCP servers don't just work technically, but actually help developers build better Amplify Gen2 applications faster and more reliably.
